          <p>Hi everyone,</p>
          <p>Iâ€™m Luo, the founder of EarlyBird.</p>
          <p>
            I have been an entrepreneur for a long time and have learned from my own mistakes. And I
            want to use my experiences to help others avoid making the same mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting a business is exciting, but it can also be challenging. You are already ahead
            of many people if you have a good idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, more is needed - you need the determination to test and validate your idea in
            the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I have seen too many similar failures, including my own, where I had an idea, bought
            a domain name, and even hired developers to create what I thought was the perfect
            product, then built something, only to find out after it that there was no demand for
            it. I have wasted a lot of time, effort, and money.
          </p>
          <p>These life experiences led me to build EarlyBird.</p>
          <p>
            With EarlyBird, it is easy for anyone to validate their idea, and you don't need coding
            skills. You can create a beautiful landing page in just 10 minutes, add a conversion
            action block, and you are ready to attract potential customers.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            If any of them show interest in your idea and are willing to pay, it's a sign that your
            concept is successful. Well done on completing the idea validation process!{' '}
          </p>
          <p>I hope EarlyBird helps you succeed in the next stage of your journey. </p>
          <p>Wishing you all the best!</p>
